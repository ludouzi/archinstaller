# archinstaller

## Description

A custom installer script for Arch Linux.

The script is tailored to my own system and needs, so it will need editing.

## Usage

While booted with the Arch iso:

```
pacman -Sy git
git clone https://github.com/ludouzi/archinstaller.git
cd archinstaller
./installer.sh
```
